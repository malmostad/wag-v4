Our web site and our web applications have a clear and distinct color scheme mostly in gray scale that gives focus to the content and the applications and makes it easy for the user to perform her tasks. Colors used in the Global Assets are defined in the [Sass variables files](https://github.com/malmostad/shared_assets/tree/master/stylesheets) in the Shared Assets. Check the `shared`, `external` and `internal` directories for `variables.scss`. You can [use it](https://github.com/malmostad/shared_assets/) in your own application, or have it as a reference if you don't use Sass.

Other colors are available in the [branding guidelines](https://malmo.se/Kommun--politik/Sa-arbetar-vi-med.../Kommunikationsfragor/Grafisk-manual.html).
